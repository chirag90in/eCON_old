Usage: ~1~
------ 
 RBA performs region-based analysis (RBA) as theoretically elaborated in the
 manuscript: https://rdcu.be/bhhJp and is conducted with a shell script (as
 shown in the examples below). The input data should be formulated in a
 pure-text table that codes the regions and variables. The response variable
 is some effect at the individual subject level.

 Thanks to Paul-Christian BuÌˆrkner and the Stan/R communities for the strong support.

=============================== 
 Read the following carefully!!!
 ===============================
 A data table in pure text format is needed as input for an RBA script. The
 data table should contain at least 3 columns that specify the information
 about subjects, regions and the response variable values with the following
 fixed header. The header lables are case-sensitive, and their order does not
 matter.

 Subj   ROI        Y      Age
 S1     Amyg    0.2643    11
 S2     BNST    0.3762    16
 ...

 0) You are performing Bayesian analysis!!! So, you will directly obtain
    the probability of an effect being positive or negative with your data,
    instead of witch hunt-hunting the straw man of p-value (weirdness of your
    data when pretending that absolutely nothing exists).

 1) Avoid using pure numbers to code the labels for categorical variables. The
    column order does not matter. You can specify those column names as you
    prefer, but it saves a little bit scripting if you adopt the default naming
    for subjects (\'Subj\'), regions (\'ROI\') and response variable (\'Y\').

 2) Add more columns if explanatory variables are considered in the model. Currently
    only between-subjects variables (e.g., sex, patients vs. controls, age) are
    allowed. Capability of modeling within-subject or repeated-measures variables
    may be added in the future. Each label in a between-subjects factor (categorical
    variable) should be coded with at least 1 character (labeling with pure numbers
    is fine but not recommended). If preferred, you can quantitatively code the
    levels of a factor yourself by creating k-1 columns for a factor with k levels.
    However, be careful with your coding strategy because it would impact how to
    interpret the results. Here is a good reference about factor coding strategies:
    https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/library/r-library-contrast-coding-systems-for-categorical-variables/

 3) It is strongly suggested that a quantitative explanatory variable be
    standardized with option -stdz; that is, remove the mean and scale by
    the standard deviation. This will improve the chance of convergence
    with each Markov chain. If a between-subjects factor (e.g., sex) is
    involved, it may be better to standardize a quantitative variable
    within each group in terms of interpretability if the mean value differs
    substantially. However, do not standardize a between-subjects factor if
    you quantitatively code it. And do not standardize the response variable
    if the intercept is of interest!

 4) For within-subject variables, try to formulate the data as a contrast
    between two factor levels or as a linear combination of multiple levels.

 5) The results from RBA are effect estimates for each region. They can be
    slightly different across different runs or different computers and R
    package versions due to the nature of randomness involved in Monte Carlo
    simulations.

 6) The evidence for region effects in the output can be assessed through P+,
    the probability that the effect is postive conditional on the current
    dataset. The following criterion for highlighting the results is only
    suggestive:
     P+ >= 0.975 or <= 0.025 - very strong evidence
     P+ >= 0.95 or <= 0.05   - strong evidence
     P+ >= 0.90 or <= 0.10   - moderate evidence
     else                    - little evidence

    The same criterion is applied to the color coding in the posterior
    distribution plots generated with the option -PDP:
     P+ >= 0.975 or <= 0.025 - green:    very strong evidence
     P+ >= 0.95 or <= 0.05   - yellow:   strong evidence
     P+ >= 0.90 or <= 0.10   - gray:     moderate evidence
     else                    - no color: little evidence

 7) WARNING: If the results are pretty homogenized across regions, it is an
    indication that presumably partial pooling becomes full pooling. Most
    likely the cross-region variability is so negligible that the model
    renders the overall average as individual effects for all regions. When
    this occurs, you may need much more data for the model to differentiate
    the subtle effects.

 =========================
 
 Installation requirements: ~1~
 In addition to R installation, the R package "brms" is required for RBA. Make
 sure you have the most recent version of R. To install "brms", run the following
 command at the terminal:

 rPkgsInstall -pkgs "brms" -site http://cran.us.r-project.org"

 Alternatively you may install them in R:

 install.packages("brms")
 
 Running: ~1~
 Once the RBA command script is constructed, it can be run by copying and
 pasting to the terminal. Alternatively (and probably better) you save the 
 script as a text file, for example, called myRBA.txt, and execute it with the 
 following  (assuming on tcsh shell),
 
 nohup tcsh -x myRBA.txt > diary.txt &
 nohup tcsh -x myRBA.txt |& tee diary.txt &

 The advantage of the commands above is that the progression is saved into
 the text file diary.txt and, if anything goes awry, can be examined later.
 The \'nohup\' command allows the analysis running in the background even if
 the terminal is killed.'

Examples: ~1~

Example 1 --- Simplest scenario. Values from regions are the input from
          each subject. No explanatory variables are considered. Research
	  interest is about the population effect at each region.

   RBA -prefix output -dataTable myData.txt  \\

   The above script is equivalent to

   RBA -prefix myResult -chains 4 -iterations 1000 -model 1 -EOI 'Intercept' \\
   -r2z -dataTable myData.txt  \\

   The 2nd version above is recommended because of its explicit specifications.

   The input file 'myData.txt' is a data table in pure text format as below: 
                                                             
     Subj  ROI          Y
     S01   lFFA       0.162
     S02   lAmygdala -0.598
     S03   DMNLAG     0.249
     S04   DMNPCC     0.568
     ...
 \n"

"--------------------------------
Example 2 --- 2 between-subjects factors (sex and group): ~2~

   RBA -prefix output -Subj subject -ROI region -Y zscore -PDP 4 4 \\
   -chains 4 -iterations 1000 -model '1+sex+group' \\
   -cVars 'sex,group' -EOI 'Intercept,sex,group' \\
   -dataTable myData.txt

   The input file 'myData.txt' is formatted as below:
   
   subject region  zscore  sex group
   S1      DMNLAG  0.274    F  patient
   S1      DMNLHC  0.443    F  patient
   S2      DMNRAG  0.455    M  contorl
   S2      DMNRHC  0.265    M  control
   ...

   Notice that the interaction between 'sex' and 'group' is not modeled in
   this case. The option -PDP 4 4 allows the program to generate a 4 x 4
   posterior distribution plots for the 16 regions.

   ex3 <-
"---------------------------------
Example 3 --- one between-subjects factor (sex), one within-subject factor (two
   conditions), one between-subjects covariate (age), and one quantitative
   variable: ~2~
    
   RBA -prefix result -PDP 4 4 -Subj Subj -ROI region -Y value \\
   -chains 4 -iterations 1000 -model '1+sex+age+SA' -qVars 'sex,age,SA' \\
   -EOI 'Intercept,sex,age,SA' -dataTable myData.txt

   The input file 'myData.txt' is formatted as below:
   
   Subj   region   value sex  age   SA
   S1    DMNLAG    0.274  1  1.73  1.73
   S1    DMNLHC    0.443  1  1.73  1.73
   S2    DMNRAG    0.455 -1 -0.52  0.52
   S2    DMNRHC    0.265 -1 -0.52  0.52
   ...

   Notice

   1) the 'Y' column is the contrast between the two conditions.
   2) since we want to model the interaction between 'sex' and 'age', 'sex' is
      coded through deviation coding.
   3) 'age' has already been standardized within each sex due to large age
      difference between the two sexes.
   4) the 'SA' column codes for the interaction between 'sex' and 'age', which
      is the product of the two respective columns.
